# The Story Behind Minefield

I worked on Minefield, a theme park management game, during the spring of 2021 for my Software Technology class.

This was my most complex and challenging project yet. I put around 300 hours into it.

That being said, it was all worth it because I learned a tremendous amount since this was the first time I used Unity and C#. What's more, considering everything, the game turned out great, and the people I showed it to enjoyed playing it.

Before I continue, however, I must also mention that as for the menu is concerned, the credit goes to my two teammates, Dominik Matiny and Kristóf Takács. They were also the ones to export the models we ended up using from Minecraft.

As for my part in the project is concerned, I implemented the core game mechanics such as the building mechanics, the behavior of the different NPCs, the camera movement, etc. I also put together a simple CI solution.

Looking back, I should have been more careful about the structure of the project and my commits, and I should have also looked up a way to simplify the constructor of the different buildings you can place in the game world.

This would have made it easier to extend upon the basic game mechanics in the future, and it would have improved the readability of the code.

At the same time, the game works as intended, and it has a nice aesthetic.

What's more, it was a blast to work on it since I got to think about and work on features in a 3D space, and implementing the behavior of the NPCs and seeing the game come to life was inspiring.

It was also crucial for me to implement algorithms that didn't use up more system resources than necessary. And based on my experience, the game runs smoothly even with thousands of NPCs interacting with the game world.

All in all, Minefield was an interesting project to work on, and I am glad it turned out the way it did.

And once the game was finished, my tutor asked me to make [a video](https://youtu.be/dvfuY1JlcvU) about it so that he could show it to others. But please note that the video is in Hungarian.
