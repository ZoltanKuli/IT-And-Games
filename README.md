# Minefield
Minefield is a Minecraft-inspired amusement park management game and my first-ever Unity project, which I made for my Software Technology class during the spring of 2021.

You can watch a demo using [this link](https://youtu.be/dvfuY1JlcvU). Please note that the video is in Hungarian, as requested by my tutor, but I made English subtitles.

# Highlights
* Implemented a robust world manager from scratch that is a core part of the building mechanics.
* Implemented a camera system for moving around in the 3D game world.
* Balanced the game so that it is fun and challenging to play.
* Set up a CI solution on GitLab.
* Added background sounds and music to the game.
* Imported and dialed in the game models and prefabs that bring the game to life.
* Implemented extensive NPC mechanics from scratch using a custom AI and the A* search algorithm.
* Implemented the crew mechanics based on the NPC mechanics.
* Implemented an input manager that handles the user input.
* Implemented a game manager that connects the core functionalities of the game with the user input.
