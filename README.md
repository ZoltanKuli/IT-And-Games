# The Story Behind Minefield

I made Minefield, a theme park management game, during the spring of 2021 for my Software Technology class.

This was my most complex and challenging project yet. And not only that, but I had a busier schedule than ever before.

On average, I would work for 16 hours a day for 3 months on either my university duties or my job-related tasks at Ericsson. At my busiest, I would not sleep for days, and specifically, this project took me around 300 hours to complete.

All that said, it was all worth it because I learned a tremendous amount, and the game turned out great.

Before I continue, however, I must also mention that as for the menu is concerned, the credit goes to my two teammates, Dominik Matiny and Kristof Tak√°cs. They were also the ones to export the models we ended up using from Minecraft.

As for my part in the project is concerned, I implemented the core game mechanics such as the building mechanics, the behavior of the different NPCs, the camera movement, etc.

Looking back, I should have been more careful about the structure of the project, and I should have also looked up a way to simplify the constructor of the different buildings you can place in the game world.

This would have made it easier to extend upon the basic game mechanics in the future, and it would have improved the readability of the code.

At the same time, the game works as intended, and it has a nice aesthetic.

What's more, it was a blast to work on it since I got to think about and work on features in the 3D space, and implementing the behavior of the NPCs and seeing the game come to life was inspiring.

It was also crucial for me to implement algorithms that didn't use up more system resources than necessary. And based on my experience, the game runs smoothly even with thousands of NPCs interacting with the game world.

All in all, Minefield was an interesting project to work on, and I am glad it turned out the way it did.

And once the game was finished, my tutor asked me to make a video about it, which you can watch using [this link](https://youtu.be/dvfuY1JlcvU). But please note that the video is in Hungarian.
